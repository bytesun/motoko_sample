The Javascript binding for optional types is [] | [T] , where an empty array represents null.
This may be what you want to pass in for that example (untested):
[{contains: ["text01"], startsWith: []}]

There’s a reference for the bindings here that can help (look for “Corresponding Javascript values” under each entry):
